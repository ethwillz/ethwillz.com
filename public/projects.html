            A traffic generator which generates realistic web traffic against a set of targets for use in Iowa State's Cyber Defense
            Competition. In the competition, it will obscure traffic coming from the "red" team who try and compromise participants ("blue" team)
            making the environment much more realistic and nearly impossible to prevent attacks by banning an IP range. In cubersecurity classes,
            it will allow professors to demonstrate tools like IDS's which can notify users of suspicious attacks, right now there's no good way to do this.

            Through this project I have become more proficient in Python, Docker, and RabbitMQ which were our main
            implementation technologies. Additionally, I learned a lot about networking which was an area I had next 
            to no experience in.

            My main contribution to the project was implenting standard web rewquests to our task-running framework. The module reads endpoints
            from the configuration file and periodically launches a new request towards a randomly selected target.

        <div>A mobile application designed for roommates with a variety of functionality such as shared gorcery lists, bill splitting,
          and messaging. The project set out to design a way to bring together a variety of apps and technologies into a single, cohesive
          application to make living easier.
        </div>
        </br>

        <div>We decided to use Xamarin for this project so I learned a lot about that framework and cross-platform mobile applications in general.
            The basde C# skills I learned here were really helpful in developing my skills for the back end work I now specialize in at work.
        </div>
        </br>

        <div>As team leader, I was the driver of the design and schedule of the work we were producing. The project design was mainly me and I also 
          contributed to implementation of the components in the system. Ultimately we did not get the project done in the semester but I learned a lot
          about team organization and scheduling of software work.

        <div>I used JavaScript which I was pretty comfortable in but got the chance to try Google Drive's API in which I got really good at how promises and 
          callbacks can be used, two topics I had not had the chance to explore in JavaScript very much before this point.

        <div>I was the only developer working on this project because we needed to replace the script we had been losing which had been lost. This forced me to put
          more thought into the design of the utility so that it can be extended in coming years as the needs of the utility grow.

            Through this project I taught myself Express, my first attempt at doing a back end in JavaScript. Using sockets was a good way to get a crash-course in this
            and was really a good experience. Additionally, this was my first experience with React which I now work with in production at work.

          <div>
            I built the whole Tic-Tac-Toe game off of a project infrastructure that my partner and I set up. He got a game working using p5.js but during our
            time trying to integrate it into the React/Express framework we encountered errors we were not able to get past.
