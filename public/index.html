                <p>One of my passions outside of tech is fashion. I worked as Fashion Director for an Iowa State publication
                called Sir Magazine for three semesters. Now I am not quite as involved, expressing this part of myself in my daily
                clothes or occasionally modeling shoot.</p>

                    Between classes and personal projects, I know a lot of languages. Check out my Github below to get

                    <p>Besides working hard, I'm a known haver-of-fun. This mostly consists of going to random
                        events around the community like art openings or Holi. My Instagram is where I post most
                        of these experiences.</p>

                <p>I really enjoy living an active and healthy lifestyle. My favorite sports are running, climbing. and lifting.
                Between the three, I never have a time when I don't want to be active. I'm slowly phasing things like Mountain Dew
                out of my diet and adding in more natural juices.</p>
